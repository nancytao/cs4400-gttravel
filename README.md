## For Cole, From Nancy debugging/suggestions
Submit button for adding city on manager,
Forcing population to be on a 100 is bad design, any way to separate from scroll wheel?
sort by in the GUI (order alphabetically, by population, etc)
no results? - new page? says no results somewhere pls
Highest rated city
location - add address, make name a dropdown


## Cole's List
Notes: Make sure forms are all in one form group
"<form>" tags for manager to force selection of data fields - see sign up page
change step on population forms
check long lat with prof
Add more searches ie location by country, event by location
add to homescreen a message box that says register successful and such
check for min password length and add *password must be more than 6 char
make location and event search a drop down
force mgr to pick a lang etc: see login
make sure minPop <= MaxPop same wiht cost
can you search by multiple categories - do it - adding any category ie language- one mandatory part. others not
~~search on the left~~
