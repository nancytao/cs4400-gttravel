Submit button for adding city on manager
Forcing population to be on a 100 is dumb, any way to separate from scroll wheel?

Notes: Make sure forms are all in one form group
<form> tags for manager to force selection of data fields - see sign up page
change step on population forms
check long lat with prof
Add more searches ie location by country, event by location
add to homescreen a message box that says register successful and such
check for min password length and add *passowrd must be more than 6 char
make location and event search a drop down

make sure minPop <= MaxPop same wiht cost
can you search by multiple catagories - do it - adding any catagory ie language- one madnatory part. others not
