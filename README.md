## For Cole, From Nancy debugging/suggestions
Submit button for adding city on manager,
Forcing population to be on a 100 is bad design, any way to separate from scroll wheel?
sort by in the GUI (order alphabetically, by population, etc)
no results? - new page? says no results somewhere pls
Highest rated city
location - add address, make name a dropdown
