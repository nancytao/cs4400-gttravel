Forcing population to be on a 100 is bad design, any way to separate from scroll wheel?
sort by in the GUI (order alphabetically, by population, etc)
no results? - new page? says no results somewhere pls
Highest rated city

wrapper: update review, make review (possibly same code just with a try catch on the "review already exists")
